# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis was completed to provide a recommendation to Louise for what she should set her Kickstarter campaign goal to for the play she is creating. We manipulated and analyzed the data to fit her specific needs and make our recommendation as described below.
    
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this chart, we filtered the data to only show the number of outcomes of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns by month. Our first observation is a large spike in the total number of successful theater campaigns started in May. This trend of a higher-than-average number of successful campaigns continues through June and July before returning to a number closer to the average in August. We also observed a steep drop-off the number of successful outcomes in November and December, likely due to the approaching holiday season where those who would normally contribute to campaigns are prioritizing their budgets for holiday festivities. We would recommend for Louise to launch her campaign in May, however launching in June or July could statistically still yield a higher chance of a having a successful campaign. We would recommend against starting a campaign in November or December.
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - Statistically, the best month to launch a campaign is May due to the large spike in the line chart. The worst month to launch a campaign is December as 49% of campaigns launched in December failed to meet their goal, likely due to the holidays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Overall, Kickstarter campaigns with goals less than $14,999 statistically had a higher chance of being fully funded than campaigns with higher goals. There were 24 total campaigns with goals between $15000 and $19999, and these campaigns had an equal percentage of successes vs. failures. Starting at the $20000 goal mark, the majority of the campaigns failed, with the exception of campaigns with goals between $35000 and $44999. This grouping saw a greater number of successful campaigns than it did failures.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - One limitation of this dataset is that it represents a sample of campaigns created in Kickstarter, not the entire population. The sample also contains quite a few obvious outliers for their goals that skew the analysis. An example of this is that every campaign with a goal of $1,000,000 or higher either failed or was canceled. Since Louise is interested in starting a campaign much smaller than that, the sample could have been reduced to only include campaigns with a more reasonable range of goals considering what she is estimating her necessary budget for the project to be.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A helpful chart to create for this study would be a line chart showing the outcome based on average donation to see if projects with larger average donations had a better chance of being fully funded over those with lesser average donations.
